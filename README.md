Model (UserDBHelper, UserContract.UserEntry): The UserDBHelper class is responsible for handling the data-related operations, such as creating, updating, and querying the database. The UserContract.UserEntry class defines the schema of the database.

View (UserDataAdapter, UserItemsBinding): The UserDataAdapter class represents the View in the MVC pattern. It's responsible for displaying the data in a RecyclerView. The UserItemsBinding is used for view binding.

Controller (HomeActivity): The HomeActivity class acts as the Controller in the MVC pattern. It handles user interactions (button clicks), communicates with the model (UserDBHelper), and updates the view (UserDataAdapter) accordingly.

the responsibilities are well-separated:

Model (UserDBHelper): Handles database operations.
View (UserDataAdapter): Manages the RecyclerView and binds data to the UI.
Controller (HomeActivity): Handles user interactions, communicates with the model, and updates the view.

Code structure effectively separates concerns, making it modular and following the MVC pattern. This organization helps maintainability and readability.
